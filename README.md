# AP-REQs-2025:
Solutions written by Jonah Zheng

# Introduction:
This repository contains the solution for the 2025th ApCSA Ap exam's FRQs.

# Experience:
> Overall the exam was not that bad
- The exam was broken into 2 parts, Mulitple Choice and FRQs <- the ones where you type random stuff instead of picking c
- The multiple choice section was pretty easy, the only part that was a bit difficult was reading all the information
- The FRQs itself it not that difficult, it might look a bit intense at first glace but after breaking it down part by part it becomes very easy.

# Improvement:
get better at reading lol
